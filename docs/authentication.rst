Authentication
==============


OAuth2 Workflows
----------------

Access tokens can be generated by OAuth2 servers.  CRUDs supports the Authentication
and Authorization Flows:

 1. Client Credentials
 2. Resource Owner Password (if a username and password is supplied)

When an `expires in` time is returned by the server the access token refreshing
is taken care of automatically.

    >>> from cruds import Client
    >>> from cruds.auth import OAuth2
    >>>
    >>> api = Client(
    ...     host="https://localhost/api/v1/",
    ...     auth=OAuth2(
                url="https://localhost/token",
    ...         client_id="id",
    ...         client_secret="secret",
    ...         scope="api",
    ...         )
    ...     )

> The OAuth 2.0 framework will take time to implement and implemented properly.
> Support in improving this coverage is very welcome. Let the project know of
> any Issues.

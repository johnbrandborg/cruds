Development
===========

Setup
-----

You can clone the source code from the official `Github <https://github.com/johnbrandborg/cruds>`_
repository::

    $ git clone https://github.com/johnbrandborg/cruds.git

Once you have a local copy of the source code use the make command to install
the package in edit mode with the develop extras::

    $ cd cruds
    $ make develop

If you don't use Make you can run the commands manually, by opening the Makefile
and copying the commands under the relevant targets into a terminal.

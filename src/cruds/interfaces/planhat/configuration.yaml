      planhat = Planhat(api_token="9PhAfMO3WllHUmmhJA4eO3tJPhDck1aKLvQ5osvNUfKYdJ7H")
      print(planhat.asset.get_by_id("extid-21432948"))

      Most methods will use the normal API token for auth, but some will use
      the tenant token (like 'segment') or no auth token but the tenant token is
      supplied directly to the method.

    models:
      - name: Asset
        docstring: |
          Assets in Planhat can represent many different things depending on your use case. It
          could be drones, if you're selling a drone tracking product, or it could be instances
          of your product in cases where a single customer can run multiple instances of your
          product in parallel.  Assets could also represent your different products.

          More generally, Assets are "nested objects" for which you may want to track usage
          separately, but don't need to treat them as separate customers with individual contacts,
          conversations, etc.
        uri: assets

      - name: Campaign
        docstring: |
          Manage campaigns you are running inside companies, e.g., to drive adoption or to deepen
          stakeholder relations.
        uri: campaigns

      - name: Churn
        docstring: |
          Each time one of your customers churns or downgrades you can add a specific log about
          this. Mostly this "churn log" is added manually by the CSM from within Planhat, but
          there may also be times when you want to add it over API, for example if you're
          capturing information about downgrades and churn natively in-app in your own platform
          and want to send that over to Planhat.

          The churn logs in Planhat typically contain the reasons for the churn, the value, date
          etc. It's important to note though that it doesn't affect actual revenue numbers and
          KPIs such as churn rate, renewal rate etc, on it's own. Those calculations are entirely
          based on underlying license data.
        uri: churn

      - name: Company
        docstring: |
          Companies ("accounts"), are your customers. Depending on your business these might be
          agencies, schools, other businesses or something else.  Companies can also be your
          previous customers and potentially future customers (prospects).

          The company object is one of the most central in Planhat since most other objects relate
          to it, and it's frequently used to filter out other information, such as endsuers,
          licenses, notes etc.

          In Planhat it is possible have a hierarchical structure for the companies, meaning that
          they can be grouped into organizations with parents and children in a tree like
          structure.
        methods:
          - create
          - update
          - get_by_id
          - get_list
          - get_lean_list
          - delete
          - bulk_upsert
        uri: companies

      - name: Conversation
        doctring: |
          Conversations can be of different types such as email, chat, support tickets and
          manually logged notes. You can also create your own types in Planhat to represent
          things such as "in person meeting", "Training" etc. The default types (email, chat,
          ticket, call) are reserved and should not be created over API.
        uri: conversations

      - name: Custom_Field
        docstring: |
          Most objects in Planaht can be customized by creating your own custom fields. Which
          model a given custom fields belongs is indicated by the parent property.

          Typically you would create the custom fields from within the Planhat app. But in some
          special cases you may find it more convenient to manage over API instead.
        methods:
          - create
          - update
          - get_by_id
          - get_list
          - delete
        uri: customfields

      - name: Enduser
        docstring: |
          An enduser represents an individual at one of your customers, typically a user of your
          product, a business contact or both. Endusers can automatically be created based on
          user tracking events, or based on conversations such as emails and tickets.

          Often this automatic creation of contacts along with sync from an external CRM or
          similar is enough. But there are also situations where you may want to be 100% sure
          all your users exist in Planhat, and then it would make sense to create them in Planhat
          over api as soon as they get created in your own system.

          If companyId is not present in the payload, and the email has a domain already
          registered within a company, then Planhat will auto-assign the new enduser to the
          company using domain matching.
        uri: endusers

      - name: Invoice
        docstring:
          Invoices are normally generated automatically in Planhat when a license is created
          organizations renewed, invoices can include multiple line items. Planhat will not
          prepare invoices that you actually can send to your customers though. They're rather
          meant to help anyone working with your customers to know the status of current and past
          invoicing.

          Invoices default date fields format should be days format integer.
          (Days since January 1, 1970, Unix epoch)
        uri: invoices

      - name: Issue
        docstring: |
          Issues typically represent Bugs or Feature Requests. Many of our customers fetch issues
          from Jira, but they can also be pushed to Planhat from other product management tools
          such as Product Board or Aha! You can also manage issues directly in Planhat without any external tool. Just keep in mind that the functionality is basic and mostly intended to contribute to the customer 360 view.

          Issues in Planhat can link to multiple companies, to multiple endusers and to multiple
          conversations.
        uri: issues

      - name: License
        docstring: |
          Licenses represent your customers' subcriptions to your service and is the base for MRR
          (or ARR) calculations and most revenue reports. For non recurring revenue, please see
          the Sale (NRR) object. There are many ways to get license data into Planhat including
          incomming webhooks and CRM integrations. In some case though, you just want to handle
          it yourself over the api, for example if the main source of license data is your own
          system.

          Licenses in Planhat can be fixed period with a defined start and end date. Or they can
          be non fixed period (sometimes called open-ended or evergreen). Open ended licenses
          initially don't have a specified end date since the customer may cancel at any time..
          once the license is churned/lost also non fixed period licenses can have an end date.
        uri: licenses

      - name: Note
        docstring: |
          Notes in Planhat are technically Conversations. You can create your own custom Touch
          Types to easily distinguish between different types of notes. You can also use custom
          fields to add more nuance to your Notes.

          It's quite common for Notes in Planhat to sync with external systems such as Salesforce,
          Notes can also be created via Zapier or Planhats's native incoming webhooks.
        uri: conversations

      - name: Metrics
        docstring: |
          While User Activity says a lot about user engagement, it doesn't always reflect the
          value created. Dimension Data is a set of model level metrics (Company by default)
          to understand how well your customers are doing, and the value they get out of your
          service.

          Depending on what metrics you pick you might either want to send it as it happens
          or once a day. Number of user logins for example. You could either send a post
          everytime a user logs in, or you could save logins at your end and send the total
          count for the day to planhat once a day. Typically the more granular data you send
          to planhat, the more options you’ll have to crunch that data later.

          Note: The end point accepts either a single object or an array, which can be useful
            if you run a batch update with some interval, or if you initially would like to
            load historical data.

          Note: regardless your location the base URL for User Tracking events is always
            https://analytics.planhat.com.
        methods:
          - epoc_days_format
          - get_dimension_data

        uri: dimensiondata

      - name: NPS
        docstring: |
          NPS records in Planhat represent the individual responses to an nps survey. Typically
          these are created automatically when running an nps campaign in Planhat, or in some
          cases imported from external NPS tools. A single enduser/contact can have multiple
          records if they responded to different surveys over time.

          Based on the NPS records each enduser and company in Planhat also get an nps score
          assigned.
        uri: nps

      - name: Opportunity
        docstring: |
          Opportunities in Planhat represent a sales opportunity, whether it's selling to a new
          customer or more commonly a chance of expanding an existing account.

          Opportunities are not the sames as Licenses, but when an opportunity is closed won in
          Planhat, there is an optional setting to generate a licenses based on the opportunity
          data.
        uri: opportunities

      - name: Objective
        docstring: |
          Being very clear and focused on your goals with customers is critical, and now you can
          track objectives and the health per objective.

          Pro-tip: use your average Objective health in the Health Score!

      - name: Project
        docstring: |
          Projects can represent many different real world objects with a natural start and stop
          date. A service provider for schools may use Projects to represent classes or courses.
          If you're selling a software to run sales competitions, then each competition may be a
          project.

          Using custom fields you can tailor projects to your needs, and just like Assets, usage
          data and time series data (metrics) can be associated with your Projetcs.
        uri: projects

      - name: Sale
        docstring: |
          The Sale (NRR) model represents not recurring revenue, like an onboarding fee, or a
          one-off professional services project.
        uri: sales

      - name: Task
        docstring: |
          Tasks are the things that you plan to do in the future. It can be a simple "to-do"
          without any specific due date, a reminder of something to be done at a specific point
          in time, or even a meeting with a start and end time.

          Most of the time these tasks will be automatically generated in Planhat based on rules
          you set up. It's also comon to have tasks as steps in a Playbook. But tasks can also be
          created ad-hoc just like you would in any task management app.

          Tasks managed over the API should typically have the mainType property set to `task`,
          the other potential value is `event`, which indicates that it was synced to or from a
          calendar like Google Calendar. Though it's also possible to create tasks of type event
          in Planhat without syncing them back to any calendar.

          Once a task is completed it's archived and genrally not visble in Planhat anymore.
          Sometimes when completing a tasks, say a training session, you want to log a note
          summarizing how it went, this is managed automatically by Planhat when working in the
          Planhat app.
        uri: tasks

      - name: Ticket
        docstring: |
          Tickets in Planhat are Conversations, so if you plan to send tickets to Planhat via API
          then you can also use that endpoint. The ticket endpoint contains a bit of convenience
          logic for save tickets specificially, like setting the proper type automatically.

          Most of our customers sync tickets from an external system like Zendesk or Salesforce.
          In case your ticketing system isn't natively supported or you have your own system for
          it, please let us know and we'll be happy to discuss how to best work with this api.
        methods:
          - bulk_upsert

      - name: User
        docstring: |
          Users are all your team members that need access to Planhat. Users can be created in
          the app, using spreadsheet upload or over api.

          If a user is flagged as inactive, they will not be able to login to Planhat and they
          will not get notifications, but they will be available for assigning accounts etc.
        uri: users

      - name: Workspace
        docstring: |
          If you work with sub-instances at your customers, e.g., connecting with different
          departments or with different versions of your product (think like a Workspace in
          Slack), then this is the object to track that engagement!
